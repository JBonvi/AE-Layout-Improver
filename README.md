### Better &amp; costumizable layout improver for Esko Automation Engine

---


Standard AE layout builder it's a very strong and adaptable instrument made for packaging industries. Useful to cut time between the realization of the single ARD design and the MFG layut, it even work with no server license avaible. 

Despite this AE Layout isn't very adaptable to an industry that don't use pre-cut paper/corrugated and not very customer-friendly due to a high technical skill required to create or read exportation file

I created these script to solve this problems

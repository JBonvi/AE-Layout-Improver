# AE Layout Improver

### Better &amp; customizable layout improver for Esko Automation Engine

TThe standard AE layout builder it's a very strong and adaptable tool made for packaging industries. It's useful to shorten the time 
between the realization of the single ARD design and the MFG layout. It even works without a server license.

Despite this AE Layout isn't very adaptable to an industry that doesn't use pre-cut paper/corrugated and it's also not very customer-friendly due to the high technical skill 
required to create or read the exported file.

These scripts were created to solve these problems.

In the picture below you can see the partial example of a flow where the "AE-Layout-Improver" script was applied.

A script to correct insertion errors on the ERP side and an easy-to-read and interactive final export in HTML complete the workflow
